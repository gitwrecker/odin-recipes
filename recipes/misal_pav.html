        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Misal pav is an iconic Maharashtrian dish made from spicy bean sprout curry topped with crunchy snacks and soaked up with fluffy bread rolls</p>
        <p>Misal pav is essentially a bean sprout curry. However, unlike the beansprouts you use in Chinese recipes, these are made from moth beans alongside moong beans. We usually grow the bean sprouts at home as they aren’t sold locally. These sprouts are cooked in a rich, unctuous, spicy gravy packed with different ingredients, and the whole thing is paired with soft, buttery bread rolls known as pav. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>Sprouted moth beans</ul>
            <ul>Turmeric powder</ul>
            <ul>Salt</ul>
            <ul>Water</ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>Rinse 2 cups of moth bean sprouts first in running water a couple of times. If you don’t have moth bean sprouts use moong bean sprouts or mixed beans sprouts. Ensure that your sprouts are clean, fresh and do not have fungus or mould on them or a stinky smell.</ol>
            <ol>Drain the water from the sprouts very well and add the sprouts to a 3 litre stove-top pressure cooker. You can also cook them in a pot or Instant pot adding enough water as required.</ol>
            <ol>Also add 2 medium-sized potatoes (chopped) and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder as required in the pressure cooker. Note that including potatoes are optional and can be skipped.</ol>
            <ol>Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in another pan. Crackle 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds first at low to medium-low heat. You can use any neutral-flavored oil or peanut oil.</ol>
